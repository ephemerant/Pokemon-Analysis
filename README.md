## Features:
- Move type coverage recommendations
- Team type/ability recommendations to minimize shared weaknesses
- BSS trio recommendations to minimize/cover weaknesses within a given team
- Node graph of a team, showing members that best pair with each other
- And more, probably

## To-Do:
- Update Type Chart to include options for "include available abilities" and "include all abilities"
- Ability to save/load teams in UI
- Adverserial analysis, i.e. given opponent's team's types/abilities, determine:
  - Their offensiveness to your team
  - Your team's offensiveness to them
  - The best overall teams against their types
  - Your team's best BSS trio vs their possible trios
- UI for adverserial analysis code
- Clean up code
